- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shubhanshi Singh!

A passionate and results-driven Python Software Developer with a knack for building robust, data-driven applications. My expertise spans developing and deploying solutions, from Stock Trading Applications and AI-powered Question-Answer platforms (using Langchain, Weaviate, FastAPI, Streamlit) to Finance Data Extraction Tools (with LLMs and MongoDB/MySQL) and Document Generation systems.

I thrive on solving complex problems and bringing innovative ideas to life through code. My academic foundation in Data Science, coupled with practical experience, allows me to approach development with an analytical mindset. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies, particularly in AI, DevOps, and security, and contribute to impactful projects.

Let's connect and build something amazing!
